#### case_parser.cpp:

Takes "cases" input from terminal as sentences and parses them to refine them into a list of details.
___

#### base_converter.cpp:

Takes a number and its base as well as a new desired base and outputs the converted number.

___

#### number_parser.cpp:

Takes a set of numbers and parses them using a specific set of odd rules and outputs the numbers that conform while adding commas to the output for readability.

___

##### min-max_parser.cpp:

Takes a strict input of 4 x and y values and finds the difference between max and min x values manipulates them for some reason.

___

#### oddoreven.cpp:

Takes a number input and outputs whether it is even or odd. I seem to remember the restrictions being only one line for the function leaving bitwise operations as the solution. I'm not sure this will compile with the way cast the input to an integer. I remember there being a restriction on not using outside libraries or streams as being the cause of intrigue.

___

#### steg.cpp:

I recall this being a program that had to parse the input into a coded message and first having to derive the algorithm from expected output examples. Short for steganography.

___

#### steg_final.cpp:

I remember that the **steg.cpp** program I submitted for a grade at the end of class didn't quite pass for every single test case and so this was the final draft I completed later that night that finally passed all of them. More of a pride thing.
