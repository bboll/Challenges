#### Disclaimer
In most cases, I have forgotten what the expected input is. Most of these were problems solved in a lab class where you had 2 hours to write a program that solved as many of the given problems for that day as possible. That being said, a lot of the expected input was very peculiar as the problems were not meant to allow for a common solution or, if they were, it was with some sick twist to input and output or a restriction on algorithm and library uses.

#### case_parser.cpp:

Takes "cases" input from terminal as sentences and parses them to refine them into a list of details.

Takes a number and its base as well as a new desired base and outputs the converted number.

___

#### number_parser.cpp:

Takes a set of numbers and parses them using a specific set of odd rules and outputs the numbers that conform while adding commas to the output for readability.

___

##### min-max_parser.cpp:

Takes a strict input of 4 x and y values and finds the difference between max and min x values using arrays and iterators for some reason.
