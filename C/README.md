#### sshfinger.cpp:
___

Required to be written with only C libraries outside of using streams for input and output. It combines the ssh and finger commands to login remotely to a host and check other user's information. It does validation on the input for syntax errors and formatting.

#### strncpy.c:
___

I vaguely recall implementing this test program to understand the dangers of using the strncpy function and functions like it due to buffer overflows.
